# math-script

math-script is a very simplistic scriipting language to
interpret common mathematical expressions.

## How to Use

    var MathScript = require('math-script');

    var script = new MathScript();
    console.log(`The result of 2+2 = ${script.execute('2 + 2')}`);
    script.execute('$x = (4 * 3) + 15');
    console.log(`$x equals to ${script.getVariable('$x')}`);
    //The result of 2+2 = 4
    //$x equals to 27

## MathScript References
### Operators
**operator_name (syntax)**
* Add(+)
* Subtract(-)
* Divide(/)
* Multiply (*)
* Power (^)
* Left Shift (<<)
* Right Shift (>>)
* Bitwise AND (&)
* Bitwise OR (|)

### Variables
Variables in MathScript are designed to be very simple, no
need for initialization(the first time you use it will
be mapped in the memory). To use them you only need one thing,
specify that it is a variable. To do that, use the symbol $
before the variable name. For example:

    $myvar = 15
    $otherVar = $myvar + 15

**REMEMBER: Variables are case-sensitive,
`$myvar` is not equal to `$MYVAR`**

### Library References

#### execute(expression)
Executes a MathScript code.

**Parameters:**
* expression: The math script expression you want to execute

**Result:** is the result of the expression

**Examples:** Check examples/simplest

#### getVariable(variable)
Retrieves a variable's value from the context

**Parameters:**
* variable: The name of the variable to be retrieved.

**Result:** is the value of the variable

**Examples:** Check examples/variables

#### setVariable(variable, value)
Sets a variable's value from the context

**Parameters:**
* variable: The name of the variable
* value: The new value to be set in the variable

**Result:** None

**Examples:** Check examples/variables

#### saveContext(file)
Exports the current context to a file

**Parameters:**
* file: The filename where the context will be saved

**Result:** A promise.

**Examples:** Not available yet.

#### saveContextSync(file)
The same as saveContext but sync.

**Parameters:**
* file: The filename where the context will be saved

**Result:** None.

**Examples:** Not available yet.

## Examples
This project is filled with examples, you can check them on
the source code in the examples directory.
* **simplest:** The hello world of the library, the simplest
code you can do using the math-script library
